# OSP Kadira APM (Kadira Notes)

This repository is used for developing Kadira APM documentation.

Some of these documents will be migrated to the 
![shathaway/kadira-server](https://github.com/shathawaykadira-server)
project.

The OSP Kadira APM is a branch from **kadira-open/kadira-server**
and is used to perform required maintenance that has been absent
for more than four years.

A significant investment of developer time is being contributed to
this effort.

I hope this set of repositories is useful for others that wish to 
use the Kadira APM code base.

Sincerely,

Steven J. Hathaway
